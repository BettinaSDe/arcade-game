Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

## What is this? 
This is an arcade game which is one of my FEND projects to improve my Javascript coding skills. The Game is recommended for all ages: from 0 - 99 years. 

## To play
Go to my Github project page and play: https://bettinasde.github.io/arcade-game/
Clone my repo and open html preview (this works offline except for streaming the video surprise): https://github.com/BettinaSDe/arcade-game/

## Instructions
* Use your arrow keys to move the player: up, down, left, right. 
* Ensure your player "princess" doesn't collide with the hearts. 
  After you crossed the game upwards and reached the water without collision three times, a nice video surprise awaits you (suitable for
  children). 
  You have three lives, before the game is over. Refresh your browser to play again. You can play as often as you want. 


This game was built majorly using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.
